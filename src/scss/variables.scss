//
// Global VARIABLES and HELPERS
//
// Place global config here like Bootstrap's _variables.scss.
// This kind of config is often required prior to importing any libraries
// (ie Bootstrap Sass), and does not produce any CSS, just variables and maps.
//
// This file is provided AUTOMATICALLY to every .scss file on the dependency
// chain via the configuration of the sass-loader within next.config.mjs.
// In other words, every .scss within /scss has `@import variables`
// silently injected into the first line.
//
// As long as everything within this files DOES NOT PRINT CSS, there will be
// no duplicated output. Again, for the people in the back:
//
// THIS FILE CONTAINS ONLY NON-PRINTING SASS, LIKE VARIABLES, MIXINS, & FUNCTIONS
// NO PRINTING SASS SHOULD BE ADDED TO THIS FILE
