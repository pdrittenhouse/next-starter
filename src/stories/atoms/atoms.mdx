# Atoms

Atoms are the basic building blocks of UI components. They are the smallest components and often represent simple UI elements like buttons, input fields, or icons. These components are usually not composed of other components and are often used as the foundation for building more complex components.

## Button

The Button component is a common example of an atom. It represents a clickable button element.

```jsx
import { Button } from './Button';

<Button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>Click me</Button>
