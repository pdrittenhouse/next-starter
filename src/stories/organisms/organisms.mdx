# Organisms

Organisms are high-level components that are composed of multiple molecules and/or atoms. They represent complex sections or modules of a user interface (UI) that serve a specific purpose or encapsulate a distinct feature. Organisms often combine smaller components like molecules and atoms to create more comprehensive and interactive UI elements.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Header } from './Header';

<Header>
</Header>
