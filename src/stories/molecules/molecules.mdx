# Molecules

Molecules are composed of one or more atoms and are more complex than atoms. They represent groups of UI elements that work together to perform a specific function or represent a distinct part of the UI.

## LoginForm

The LoginForm molecule is a common example of a molecule. It typically consists of an input field for username, an input field for password, and a submit button.

```jsx
import { LoginForm } from './LoginForm';

<LoginForm onSubmit={(values) => console.log('Form submitted with values:', values)} />
