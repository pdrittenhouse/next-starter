# Protons

Protons serve as the foundational building blocks of the UI, representing base components that encapsulate simple and reusable visual elements. They are fundamental units that form the basis of more complex molecules and organisms in the UI architecture. Protons are designed to be highly reusable and versatile, providing essential functionality and styling that can be easily incorporated into various parts of an application.
