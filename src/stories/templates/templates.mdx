# Templates

Templates provide a structured framework for organizing and presenting content within the UI. They define the overall layout and design patterns used across multiple pages or sections of an application. Templates serve as blueprints for constructing consistent and cohesive user experiences by specifying the arrangement of components, navigation elements, and visual hierarchy. They offer a standardized approach to designing interfaces, ensuring uniformity and efficiency in development while facilitating scalability and maintainability. Templates streamline the process of creating new pages or sections by providing a predefined structure that can be customized to accommodate specific content and functionality requirements.
