# Page

This component represents a page in the application.

## Usage

```jsx
import { Page } from './Page';

<Page />;
```

## Query

This component utilizes Apollo Client to fetch data. The GraphQL query used is as follows:

```gql
query GetToasters {
  toasters {
    edges {
      node {
        id
        title
        slug
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Mock Data

This component provides mock data for the toasters query. The mock data includes a list of toasters with their id, title, and slug fields.

## Loading State

While the data is being fetched, the component displays a loading indicator.

## Error Handling

If an error occurs during data fetching, the component displays an error message.

## Recommendations

- Utilize the component-driven development approach for building UIs.
- Use mock data to render pages in Storybook for easy review and testing.
- Refer to Storybook tutorials and documentation for more guidance on component-driven development.
