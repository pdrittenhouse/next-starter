# Page

Pages represent individual screens or views within an application where users interact with content and perform tasks. They encapsulate distinct sections of functionality and serve as entry points for navigating the application's features and accessing relevant information. Pages typically correspond to specific URLs and are responsible for rendering the UI components and orchestrating data flow to present meaningful content to users. They play a crucial role in defining the overall structure and flow of the application, providing clear pathways for users to achieve their objectives. Pages often contain a combination of reusable components, such as headers, footers, and navigation menus, tailored to deliver a cohesive user experience across different sections of the application.
